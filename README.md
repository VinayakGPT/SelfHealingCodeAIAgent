# SelfHealingCodeAIAgent
An intelligent system that automatically detects, diagnoses, and fixes runtime code errors using LangGraph workflow orchestration and ChromaDB vector storage. The system maintains a memory of encountered bugs and their fixes through vector embeddings, enabling pattern recognition for similar errors across the codebase.
